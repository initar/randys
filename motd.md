**- BE RESPECTFUL -**
We DO NOT tolerate any form of racist, homophobic, transphobic, sexist, or discriminatory behavior. Language is also automatically monitored in-game and can lead to a mute or ban.

**- DO NOT FORCE DUELS -**
Feinting, blocking movement, kicking, or hitting a player when they do not wish to fight you is classed as trolling and is against our rules.

**- FAIR PLAY POLICY -**
We do not tolerate the use of cheats, or any third-party software that gives you an advantage over other players.

**- USE COMMON SENSE -**
Listen to admins, they have the final say, if you feel that an admin is in the wrong/abusing their power then please record video evidence, and report it in our discord.
